The app will consist of 2 screens, home screen where it shows a list of contact and a contact details screen. By tapping the `ContactRow` in the Home screen, the app will navigate user to the contact details screen with the correct contact details.

# Step 1: Install dependencies

To implement navigation functionalities in the app, we need to install new dependencies.

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```

These dependencies are required for the app to use a library called [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started).

\*Make sure to restart Metro server to allow the app uses the installed dependencies.

# Step 2: Create a home screen

Starts by creating a native stack navigator

`createNativeStackNavigator` is a function that returns an object containing 2 properties: `Screen` and `Navigator`. Both of them are React components used for configuring the navigator. The `Navigator` should contain `Screen` elements as its children to define the configuration for routes.

`NavigationContainer` is a component which manages our navigation tree and contains the navigation state. This component must wrap all navigators structure. Usually, weâ€™d render this component at the root of our app, which is usually the component exported from `App.tsx`.

```tsx
// App.tsx

import * as React from "react"
import { View, Text } from "react-native"
import { NavigationContainer } from "@react-navigation/native"
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from "@react-navigation/native-stack"

function HomeScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center" }}>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator()

function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  )
}

export default App
```
